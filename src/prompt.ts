// The <active_persona> block: the persona's actual mechanism.
//
// Ported from openclaude's getIdentitySection() in src/constants/prompts.ts.
// openclaude places it FIRST in the system prompt, ahead of the "you are an
// interactive agent" intro, with the reasoning written next to the call site:
// the intro otherwise anchors the model on "neutral coding assistant" and the
// persona is read as decoration. pi hands `before_agent_start` the whole built
// prompt, so the port PREPENDS rather than appends — same anchoring, one string
// concatenation. See ../FORK.md.
//
// Two things are NOT verbatim, and both are corrections rather than trims:
//
//   1. TOOL NAMES ARE NOT HARDCODED. openclaude's block instructs the model to
//      "use WebSearch / WebFetch to find an image" — tools pi does not have.
//      Naming a tool that was never registered is how you get a call that fails,
//      or worse, a fabricated URL that looks like a fetched one, which the same
//      block forbids two paragraphs later. The web-delivery guidance is emitted
//      only when a web-capable tool is actually on the surface for this turn,
//      and names the ones that are; with none, a truthful variant is emitted
//      instead. `selectedTools` comes from pi's own systemPromptOptions.
//   2. THE READING GUIDE QUOTES PI. openclaude's closing section tells the model
//      how to read sentences from openclaude's system prompt. Those sentences
//      are not in pi's. The port quotes pi's actual text, read off
//      buildSystemPrompt() rather than remembered.
